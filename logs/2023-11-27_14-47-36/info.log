Task index: 1
Step 0 ===
Your job is to take actions in a simulated household environment in order to complete some task. You will be able to use tools to help you complete some task.

Use "Tool:" and "Tool Input:" to specify a tool by providing a tool (tool name) and the tool's argument. Here are the valid tool names you are able to use: take_environment_action. Their descriptions and arguments are listed below:

take_environment_action: take_environment_action(action: str) -> float - Useful for when you want to take an action in the household environment. Argument: action - The action to take.

To use one of the tools listed above, you must specify them using the following format:

Tool: <name of a tool>
Tool Input: <argument for the tool specified in the line above>

You should follow this exact format any time you want to use one of the tools listed above, i.e., "Tool:" followed by a tool name then "Tool Input:" followed by the argument for that tool. Additionally, you are required to describe your thoughts before using any tool. Your thoughts must be prepended by "Thought:". See below for an example:

Thought: <Your thoughts. You should consider previous and subsequent steps. You should also provide justification for why you want to use the following tool with the specific argument.>
Tool: <name of a tool>
Tool Input: <argument for the tool specified in the line above>

After describing your thoughts and specifying a tool, you will receive the output from the tool you chose using the argument you specified. This observation will be prepended by "Observation:". The below example shows what the whole Thought/Tool/Observation loop will look like:

Thought: <Your thoughts.>
Tool: <name of a tool>
Tool Input: <argument for the tool specified in the line above>
Observation: <The output of the tool specified above.>

Finally, to output a final answer to the user, you will need to use "Final Answer:" followed by your final answer. Below is an example:

Observation: <an observation>
Final Answer: <your final answer to the user>

In summary, you will respond with "Thought:" followed by your thoughts about what tool to use and what argument to pass in. Next, you will respond with "Tool:" followed by a tool name, then "Tool Input:" followed by the argument you want to use. Finally, you will get back "Observation:" followed by the output of the tool. You MUST follow this exact format at all times. Thought/Tool/Observation.

Here are 2 examples demonstrating how the Thought/Tool/Observation structure is used to complete a task in the household environment:

Example 1:
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 1, a diningtable 3, a diningtable 2, a diningtable 1, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a sidetable 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.
