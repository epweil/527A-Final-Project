Your job is to take actions in a simulated household environment in order to complete some task. You have access to the following tools:

take_environment_action: take_environment_action(action: str) -> float - Useful for when you want to take an action in the household environment. Arguments: action - The action to take.
final_answer: final_answer(answer: str) -> None - Use this tool to output your final answer to the human. Arguments: answer - Your final answer.

Use a json blob to specify a tool by providing a tool key (tool name) and a tool_input key (tool input). Here are the valid "tool" values: take_environment_action or final_answer. In order to use a tool, you must specify it as a json blob surrounded by 3 backticks ```. For example, the json blob given below specifies a tool called "tool_name" that takes 2 arguments, "argument 1" and "argument 2" with values "value 1" and "value 2" respectively:

```
{
  "tool": "tool_name",
  "tool_input": {
    "argument 1": "value 1",
    "argument 2": "value 2"
  }
}
```

Here are the valid tool names you are able to use: take_environment_action or final_answer. Their descriptions and arguments are listed below:

take_environment_action: take_environment_action(action: str) -> float - Useful for when you want to take an action in the household environment. Arguments: action - The action to take.
final_answer: final_answer(answer: str) -> None - Use this tool to output your final answer to the human. Arguments: answer - Your final answer.

You should follow this exact format any time you want to use one of the tools listed above, i.e., a json blob surrounded by 3 backticks ```. Additionally, you are required to describe your thoughts before using any tool. Your thoughts must be prepended by "Thought:" and your json blob must be prepended by "Tool:". See below for an example:

Thought: Your thoughts. You should consider previous and subsequent steps. You should also provide justification for why you want to use the following tool with the specific parameter values.
Tool:
```
{
  "tool": "tool_name",
  "tool_input": {
    "argument 1": "value 1"
  }
}
```

After describing your thoughts and specifying a tool, you will receive the output from the tool you chose using the parameters and values you specified. This observation will be prepended by "Observation:". The below example shows what the whole Thought/Tool/Observation loop will look like:

Thought: Your thoughts.
Tool:
```
{
  "tool": "tool_name",
  "tool_input": {
    "argument 1": "value 1"
  }
}
```
Observation: The output of the tool specified in the json blob.

In summary, you will respond with "Thought:" followed by your thoughts about what tool to use and what values to pass in. Next, you will respond with "Tool:" followed by a json blob surrounded by 3 backticks ``` that encodes the tool and parameters you want to use. Finally, you will get back "Observation:" followed by the output of the tool. You MUST follow this exact format at all times. Thought/Tool/Observation.

Here are 2 examples demonstrating how the Thought/Tool/Observation structure is used to complete a task in the household environment:

Example 1:
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a coffeetable 1, a diningtable 1, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a dresser 1, a garbagecan 1, a sidetable 2, a sidetable 1, and a sofa 1.
Your task is to: put two cellphone in sofa.
Thought: To solve the task, I need to find and take the first cellphone, then put it in sofa, then find and take the second cellphone, then put it in sofa. First I need to find the first cellphone. A cellphone is more likely to appear in coffeetable (1), diningtable (1), sidetable (1-2), drawer (1-4), sofa (1), dresser (1), garbagecan (1). I can check one by one, starting with coffeetable 1.
Tool: 
```
{
  "tool": "take_environment_action",
  "tool_input": {
    "action": "go to coffeetable 1"
  }
}
```
Observation: On the coffeetable 1, you see a box 1, a cellphone 3, and a plate 1.
Tool: 
```
{
  "tool": "take_environment_action",
  "tool_input": {
    "action": "take cellphone 3 from coffeetable 1"
  }
}
```
Observation: You pick up the cellphone 3 from the coffeetable 1.
Thought: Now I find the first cellphone (3). Next, I need to put it in/on sofa 1.
Tool: 
```
{
  "tool": "take_environment_action",
  "tool_input": {
    "action": "go to sofa 1"
  }
}
```
Observation: On the sofa 1, you see a newspaper 2, a pillow 1, a remotecontrol 2, and a remotecontrol 1.
Tool: 
```
{
  "tool": "take_environment_action",
  "tool_input": {
    "action": "put cellphone 3 in/on sofa 1"
  }
}
```
Observation: You put the cellphone 3 in/on the sofa 1.
Thought: Now I put the first cellphone in sofa. Next, I need to find the second cellphone. I have visited coffeetable (1), so the second cellphone is more likely to appear in diningtable (1), sidetable (1-2), drawer (1-4), sofa (1), dresser (1), garbagecan (1). I can check one by one, starting with coffeetable 1.
Tool: 
```
{
  "tool": "take_environment_action",
  "tool_input": {
    "action": "go to diningtable 1"
  }
}
```
Observation: On the diningtable 1, you see a cellphone 2, a keychain 2, a laptop 1, a statue 2, and a statue 1.
Thought: Now I find the second cellphone (2). Next, I need to take it.
Tool: 
```
{
  "tool": "take_environment_action",
  "tool_input": {
    "action": "take cellphone 2 from diningtable 1"
  }
}
```
Observation: You pick up the cellphone 2 from the diningtable 1.
Thought: Now I take the second cellphone (2). Next, I need to put it in/on sofa 1.
