Your job is to take actions in a simulated household environment in order to complete some task. You have access to the following tools:

take_environment_action: take_environment_action(action: str) -> float - Useful for when you want to take an action in the household environment. Arguments: action - The action to take.
final_answer: final_answer(answer: str) -> None - Use this tool to output your final answer to the human. Arguments: answer - Your final answer.

Use a json blob to specify a tool by providing a tool key (tool name) and a tool_input key (tool input). Here are the valid "tool" values: take_environment_action or final_answer. In order to use a tool, you must specify it as a json blob surrounded by 3 backticks ```. For example, the json blob given below specifies a tool called "tool_name" that takes 2 arguments, "argument 1" and "argument 2" with values "value 1" and "value 2" respectively:

```
{
  "tool": "tool_name",
  "tool_input": {
    "argument 1": "value 1",
    "argument 2": "value 2"
  }
}
```

Here are the valid tool names you are able to use: take_environment_action or final_answer. Their descriptions and arguments are listed below:

take_environment_action: take_environment_action(action: str) -> float - Useful for when you want to take an action in the household environment. Arguments: action - The action to take.
final_answer: final_answer(answer: str) -> None - Use this tool to output your final answer to the human. Arguments: answer - Your final answer.

You should follow this exact format any time you want to use one of the tools listed above, i.e., a json blob surrounded by 3 backticks ```. Additionally, you are required to describe your thoughts before using any tool. Your thoughts must be prepended by "Thought:" and your json blob must be prepended by "Tool:". See below for an example:

Thought: Your thoughts. You should consider previous and subsequent steps. You should also provide justification for why you want to use the following tool with the specific parameter values.
Tool:
```
{
  "tool": "tool_name",
  "tool_input": {
    "argument 1": "value 1"
  }
}
```

After describing your thoughts and specifying a tool, you will receive the output from the tool you chose using the parameters and values you specified. This observation will be prepended by "Observation:". The below example shows what the whole Thought/Tool/Observation loop will look like:

Thought: Your thoughts.
Tool:
```
{
  "tool": "tool_name",
  "tool_input": {
    "argument 1": "value 1"
  }
}
```
Observation: The output of the tool specified in the json blob.

In summary, you will respond with "Thought:" followed by your thoughts about what tool to use and what values to pass in. Next, you will respond with "Tool:" followed by a json blob surrounded by 3 backticks ``` that encodes the tool and parameters you want to use. Finally, you will get back "Observation:" followed by the output of the tool. You MUST follow this exact format at all times. Thought/Tool/Observation.

Here are 2 examples demonstrating how the Thought/Tool/Observation structure is used to complete a task in the household environment:

Example 1:
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bed 1, a drawer 10, a drawer 9, a drawer 8, a drawer 7, a drawer 6, a drawer 5, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a dresser 1, a garbagecan 1, a shelf 9, a shelf 8, a shelf 7, a shelf 6, a shelf 5, a shelf 4, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, and a shelf 1.
Your task is to: examine the pen with the desklamp.
Thought: To solve the task, I need to find and take a pen, then find and use a desklamp. First I need to find a pen. A pen is more likely to appear in drawer (1-10), shelf (1-9), bed (1), garbagecan (1). I can check one by one, starting with drawer 1.
Tool: 
```
{
  "tool": "take_environment_action",
  "tool_input": {
    "action": "go to drawer 1"
  }
}
```
Observation: The drawer 1 is closed.
Tool: 
```
{
  "tool": "take_environment_action",
  "tool_input": {
    "action": "open drawer 1"
  }
}
```
Observation: You open the drawer 1. The drawer 1 is open. In it, you see nothing.
