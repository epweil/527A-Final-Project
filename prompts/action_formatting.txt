Use "Tool:" and "Tool Input:" to specify a tool by providing a tool (tool name) and the tool's argument. Here are the valid tool names you are able to use: {tool_names}. Their descriptions and arguments are listed below:

{tools}

To use one of the tools listed above, you must specify them using the following format:

Tool: <name of a tool>
Tool Input: <argument for the tool specified in the line above>

You should follow this exact format any time you want to use one of the tools listed above, i.e., "Tool:" followed by a tool name then "Tool Input:" followed by the argument for that tool. Additionally, you are required to describe your thoughts before using any tool. Your thoughts must be prepended by "Thought:". See below for an example:

Thought: <Your thoughts. You should consider previous and subsequent steps. You should also provide justification for why you want to use the following tool with the specific argument.>
Tool: <name of a tool>
Tool Input: <argument for the tool specified in the line above>

After describing your thoughts and specifying a tool, you will receive the output from the tool you chose using the argument you specified. This observation will be prepended by "Observation:". The below example shows what the whole Thought/Tool/Observation loop will look like:

Thought: <Your thoughts.>
Tool: <name of a tool>
Tool Input: <argument for the tool specified in the line above>
Observation: <The output of the tool specified above.>

Finally, to output a final answer to the user, you will need to use "Final Answer:" followed by your final answer. Below is an example:

Observation: <an observation>
Final Answer: <your final answer to the user>

In summary, you will respond with "Thought:" followed by your thoughts about what tool to use and what argument to pass in. Next, you will respond with "Tool:" followed by a tool name, then "Tool Input:" followed by the argument you want to use. Finally, you will get back "Observation:" followed by the output of the tool. You MUST follow this exact format at all times. Thought/Tool/Observation.
