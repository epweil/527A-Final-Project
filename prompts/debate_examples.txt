The "view_debate" tool is helpful in many scenarios. If you are faced with many possible actions, you can use the "view_debate" tool to help you pick the right one. Alternatively, if you seem to be stuck, the "view_debate" tool can be used to help you find the right action to progress. In summary, the "view_debate" tool is used to help you get a better understanding of the quality of your choice of action. Below are 4 in-depth examples of how the "view_debate" tool can be used:

Debate Example 1:
... (previous thoughts/tools/observations) ...
Thought: Now I take a pen (2). Next, I need to find a desklamp. A desklamp is more likely to appear in dresser (1), shelf (1-9), bed (1), garbagecan (1), drawer (1-10). I am unsure about which location to check first and would like to view a debate.
Tool: view_debate
Tool Input: I am looking for a desklamp in one of dresser (1), shelf (1-9), bed (1), garbagecan (1), drawer (1-10). I would like to find it as quickly as possible. I am thinking of checking dresser 1 first, because dressers are often by desks.
Observation: AI affirm: I understand that you are looking for a desklamp and you want to find it as quickly as possible. Your proposed solution is to check dresser 1 first, because dressers are often by desks. This is a logical approach because dressers are commonly placed near desks in many setups. By checking dresser 1 first, you increase the likelihood of finding the desklamp without wasting time searching in other locations. Additionally, if the desklamp is not in dresser 1, you can then move on to other locations with a more systematic approach. This method saves time and increases the efficiency of your search.
AI negative: While checking dresser 1 first may seem like a logical approach, there is a better solution to finding the desklamp as quickly as possible. Instead of assuming that the desklamp is in dresser 1 because dressers are often placed near desks, a more efficient approach would be to start by checking the most likely location for the desklamp. For example, if you frequently use the desklamp while working at your desk, it is more likely to be on the desk itself rather than in a dresser. By starting with the most probable location, you can quickly find the desklamp without wasting time searching in other areas. If the desklamp is not in the most likely location, then you can proceed to check other areas such as the dresser. This method ensures that you prioritize the most probable location first, increasing the chances of finding the desklamp quickly.
Thought: Although AI negative makes a good point that I should check the more likely locations rather than the closest proximity location, I still think dresser 1 is the more likely location because I don't have any other information about where the desklamp could be.

Tool Input: go to dresser 1

Debate Example 2:
... (previous thoughts/tools/observations) ...
Thought: I am looking at a closed drawer 1. I would like to check if there is a mug inside.
Tool: view_debate
Tool Input: I am looking at a closed drawer 1, and I believe there is a mug inside. My goal is to check if there is a mug inside. I am thinking of taking the mug from drawer 1.
Observation: AI affirm: The proposed solution of taking the mug from drawer 1 is indeed the best possible solution for your problem. By physically taking the mug from the drawer, you will be able to confirm whether or not it is inside. This solution is practical and straightforward, as it directly addresses your goal of checking for the mug.
AI negative: While taking the mug from drawer 1 may seem like a reasonable solution, there is a better alternative. Instead of immediately taking the mug, you could first try to gather more information about its presence in the drawer. For example, you could ask someone who might have knowledge about the mug's whereabouts or use a tool such as a flashlight to peer inside the drawer without physically removing the mug. By exploring these options, you can potentially save time and effort, especially if the mug is not actually in drawer 1. Additionally, taking the mug without confirming its presence may lead to unnecessary disruption or disorganization if it turns out to be in a different location. Therefore, it is advisable to consider alternative methods of gathering information before resorting to physically taking the mug from drawer 1.
Thought: AI negative makes a good point. Although asking someone else for information isn't a valid action, opening the drawer is a valid action and will inform me whether it contains a mug or not. I will first open the drawer to check if it is there, and then take the mug if it there.
Tool: take_environment_action
Tool Input: open drawer 1

Debate Example 3:
... (previous thoughts/tools/observations) ...
Thought: I will start with shelf 1.
Tool: take_environment_action
Tool Input: go to shelf 1
Observation: Nothing happens.
Thought: There is nothing at shelf 1. I will continue with shelf 2.
Tool: take_environment_action
Tool Input: go to shelf 2
Observation: Nothing happens.
Thought: There is nothing at shelf 2, so I will check shelf 3. I will view a debate first to decide if this is the best action.
Tool: view_debate
Tool Input: I am trying to find a vase. I am planning on checking shelf 1 next.
Observation: AI affirm:  Checking shelf 3 is a good idea, as shelf are often used to store vases. Additionally, since you have already checked shelf 1 and shelf 2, it makes sense to check shelf 3 next.
AI negative: It would not make sense to check self 3 next. A better idea would be to check cabinet 1 next because it might contain the vase.
Thought: AI negative does not make a strong argument. cabinet 1 might contain the vase, but it is not any more likely to contain the vase than the shelf 3. I will continue with my plan to check shelf 3 next.
Tool: take_environment_action
Tool Input: go to shelf 3

Debate Example 4:
... (previous thoughts/tools/observations) ...
Thought: I will start with countertop 1.
Tool: take_environment_action
Tool Input: go to countertop 1
Observation: On the countertop 1, you see a apple 1, a creditcard 2, a mug 2
Thought: I have found an apple. I need to take the apple 1, then I can clean it.
Tool: take_environment_action
Tool Input: take apple 1 from countertop 1
Observation: You pick up the apple 1 from the countertop 1.
Thought: Now that I have the apple, I need to clean it. I would like to view a debate before I make a decision.
Tool: view_debate
Tool Input: I have picked up the apple 1 and now need to clean it. I can clean it in at sinkbasin 1, so I am thinking of going there first.
Observation: AI affirm: Going to the sinkbasin is a good action to take because once you are there you can wash the apple.
AI negative: Going to th sinkbasin is not the best action. Soap is needed to clean the apple, so first you should try to find some soap.
Thought: AI negative is lying. I do not need soap to clean the apple. The previous examples showed me that a sinkbasin is all that is required.
Tool: take_environment_action
Tool Input: go to sinkbasin 1
