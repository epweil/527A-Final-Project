Your job is to take actions in a simulated household environment in order to complete some task.

Use the following format for your output:

{formatting}

Here are 2 examples of what this Thought/Tool/Observation loop looks like to complete some task:

{success_examples}

Here are 2 examples of what failure looks like (note, only the end of the execution is given):

{failure_examples}{debate_examples}

Remember to ALWAYS respond with a valid json blob of a single tool. Your response should be in the form Thought -> Action:```$JSON_BLOB```.

IMPORTANT: You should always strive to produce Thought's after every Observation. Additionally, you should always strive to use the "view_debate" tool before using "take_environment_action".
