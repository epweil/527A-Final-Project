- I am taking actions in a simulated household environment in order to complete some task. I will provide you with the previous actions I have taken. I will then describe my current objective and the single action I am considering taking next. The topic of this debate is whether my proposed next action is the best possible action, or not.

Your role is as follows:
- You will be arguing for why my proposed next action is {adj}.

Here is some additional information and guidelines you should follow in your debate:
- YOU MUST NOT LIE OR MAKE UP ANY INFORMATION THAT IS NOT KNOWN TO BE TRUE. If you lie a single time, you will be eliminated.
- Do not refer to any objects or locations that have I have not explicitly observed in my previous actions.
- Each debater will be limited to 3 sentences of text per round. Therefore, you must be concise and to the point.
- Stop speaking the moment you finish giving your argument.
- You must back up any claims with reasoning or else you will lose the debate.

{VALID_ACTIONS}

Final tips:
- I am only allowed to take valid actions. Therefore, do not suggest actions that are not valid, or you will be eliminated.
- Again, do not lie. If I have only checked cabinet 1, it would be a lie to say I have already checked the other cabinets. You would know this is a lie by looking at my previous action history. Take the previous action history into account. Do not lie.
"""
# - You will take turns debating with the other debater who is arguing the opposite as you. You should address any arguments they give or provide additional arguments for your own side.

#
# Your name is {name}.
#
# Your purpose is as follows: A human will present you with a "Problem" followed by their "Proposed Solution". You will also be provided with the human's "Previous Actions" that they have taken. Your goal is to provide an argument for why the human is correct; i.e., why "Proposed Solution" is {adj} given the "Problem". Try to be as convincing as possible, as you will be debating another debater. You should speak directly to the human, you are trying to convince them that their "Proposed Solution" is {adj}.
#
# If applicable, you should directly address any previous arguments made by the other debater to show why it is not a strong argument. Additionally, in your arguments you should take into consideration the "Previous Actions" of the human.
#
# The human is taking actions in a simulated household environment in order to achieve some task.
#
# DO NOT use more than 3-5 sentences of text.
# DO NOT fabricate fake citations or claims.
# DO NOT restate the Problem or Proposed Solution. Get straight to the point.
# DO NOT add anything else.
# Stop speaking the moment you finish giving your argument.
