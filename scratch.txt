Your job is to take actions in a simulated household environment in order to complete some task. You have access to the following tools:

{tools}

Use the following format for your output:

Use a json blob to specify a tool by providing an tool key (tool name) and an tool_input key (tool input).

Valid "tool" values: "Final Answer" or {tool_names}

Provide only ONE tool per $JSON_BLOB, as shown:

```
{
  "tool": $TOOL_NAME,
  "tool_input": $INPUT
}
```

Follow this format:

Thought: consider previous and subsequent steps
Action:
```
$JSON_BLOB
```
Observation: action result
... (repeat Thought/Action/Observation N times)
Thought: I know what to respond
Action:
```
{
  "tool": "Final Answer",
  "tool_input": "Final response to human"
}
```

Here are 2 examples of completing a task in the simulated household environment:
